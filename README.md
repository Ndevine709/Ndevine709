# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Noah Devine â€” A Junior Front-End Developer

Iâ€™m a recent graduate of the Software Development program at Keyin College, now focused on building sleek, scalable front-end experiences. Before diving into tech, I spent four and a half years at BMW St. Johnâ€™s, where I sharpened my communication and teamwork skills â€” both of which now help me thrive in collaborative dev environments.

Iâ€™ve been working with Python, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and UI/UX design. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to front-end architecture and love building interfaces that are both scalable and user-friendly. On the back-end, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation working with RESTful APIs, MongoDB, SQL, MySQL Workbench, and Spring Boot â€” and Iâ€™m continuing to expand that skill set through hands-on projects.

I love solving problems, building interactive interfaces, and learning new tools that push my abilities further. Whether itâ€™s a solo project or a team sprint, Iâ€™m always up for a challenge â€” especially the kind that helps me grow as a developer.
