# Welcome to my Github Profile!

Hello, my name is Noah Devine and I am a dedicated and passionate software development student currently in my fourth semester at Keyin College. After four and a half years of experience at BMW St. Johnâ€™s, where I honed strong teamwork and communication skills, I made the decision to pursue my long-standing goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.

I am proficient in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and UI/UX design, with a focus on Front-End Development. My passion for technology drives me to continually learn and improve, always looking to create innovative and efficient solutions.

I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to collaborative and challenging projects that align with my passion for technology.
